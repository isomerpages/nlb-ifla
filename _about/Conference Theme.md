## **AI in Focus: Artificial Intelligence and Libraries**

The IFLA Information Technology (IT) Section in collaboration with the National Library Board is delighted to call for presentations and paper proposals for a satellite conference in Singapore on the topic of Artificial Intelligence, its responsible use and education in libraries and information services and the relationship with Big Data. This conference is a collaboration between the Â IFLA IT Section, the Big Data Special Interest Group and the Artificial Intelligence Special Interest Group.

Following on from our successful satellite conference in Galway, the IFLA Information Technology Section is planning sessions and workshops to provide insight into the role of libraries in the responsible use of AI. We are witnessing the adoption of AI in all aspects of library operations, including public and reference services, automated classification, customer service through chatbots and discovery systems. Vendors are adding elements of AI in library products including discovery and research platforms. IFLA has recognised the importance of AI and the formation of an AI SIG. The role and impact of AI present both opportunities and challenges. IT plays a significant role in the development and use of AI technologies, but its uses can have considerable impact and possible unintended consequences on library staff, operations and services.

This in-person and online (streamed) conference will provide an opportunity to explore AI, including its practical implementation and opportunities on the horizon as well as the ethical, transparency, and unconscious bias considerations for responsible use. We are keen to see proposals that explore the important connections between the AI technologies and the operations and/or service side of all types of Libraries.
