The IFLA Information Technology (IT) Section in collaboration with the National Library Board is delighted to call for presentations and paper proposals for a satellite conference in Singapore on the topic of Artificial  Intelligence, its responsible use and education in libraries and information  services and the relationship with Big Data. This conference is a  collaboration between the  IFLA IT Section, the Big Data Special Interest Group and the Artificial Intelligence Special Interest Group.

**Proposals are due by 30th November 2022.**

Following on from our successful satellite conference in Galway, the IFLA Information Technology Section is planning sessions and workshops to provide insight into the role of libraries in the responsible use of AI. We are  witnessing the adoption of AI in all aspects of library operations, including public and reference services, automated classification, customer service through chatbots and discovery systems. Vendors are adding elements of AI in library products including discovery and research platforms. IFLA has recognised the importance of AI and the formation of an AI SIG.  The role and impact of AI present both opportunities and challenges. IT plays a significant role in the development and use of AI technologies, but its uses can have considerable impact and possible unintended consequences on library staff, operations and services.

This in-person and online (streamed) conference will provide an opportunity to explore AI, including its practical implementation and opportunities on the horizon as well as the ethical, transparency, and unconscious bias considerations for responsible use. We are keen to see proposals that explore the important connections between the AI technologies and the operations and/or service side of all types of Libraries.

We invite papers, presentations, demonstrations, workshops and posters. Topics include but not limited to:
* AI and Big Data in libraries  
* Library participation in AI projects  
* Ethical considerations around AI, including algorithmic bias, privacy and transparency
* AI technologies including natural language processing, machine and deep learning platforms, text mining, speech/facial recognition, multi format content recognition and processing, virtual agents, and decision management
* Use of AI in open search and discovery systems and the impact on reference work and chat/question answer services
* Innovation in service delivery and library operations including user interface design and user experience  
* Library use of chatbots and involvement in chatbot development  
* Use and impact of AI-optimized hardware and "smart" devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple Siri.  
* Search algorithms, and algorithmic literacy
* Library roles in promoting data and algorithmic literacy among users and citizens
* Developing skills and capacity for AI work and examinations of roles of library workers and data scientists in this work

Submissions must include:
*  Name, title, institution, country, and email of speaker(s)
*  Brief biographical statement about each speaker (max 100 words)  
*  Title of proposed presentation  
*  Abstract of presentation (max 300 words)
