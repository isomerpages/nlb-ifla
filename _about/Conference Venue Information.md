## The National Library Building
### About the Location
The National Library Building&nbsp;at 100 Victoria Street is the headquarters of the&nbsp;[National Library Board](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-03-23_150155.html) (NLB). Opened in 2005, the Victoria Street premises replaced the&nbsp;[old National Library Building](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_661_2004-12-27.html)&nbsp;on&nbsp;[Stamford Road](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_865_2005-01-24.html). The 16-storey complex houses mainly the collections of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, with the Central Public Library occupying the first of three basement floors. Designed by ecologically conscious architect Ken Yeang, the building is replete with environment-friendly architectural features, and has garnered many accolades both at home and abroad.
